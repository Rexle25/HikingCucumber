# Hiking Cucumber

With Hiking Cucumber, you can play various outdoor GPS games. The games are all browser-based. Originally, this project was only supposed to be a scavenger hunt website, but I made it bigger and more diverse.

There are many different ways to use this project. It can be used for educational purposes, as motivation to exercise more, or simply for fun. 



## Game Modes

There are currently three mostly finished game modes. All of them are playable, but I plan to improve them in the future. 

### scavenger hunt
You can easily play and create scavenger hunts. The scavenger hunts are easy to export and modify because they are simple JSON files.

### cucumber hunt
In this game mode, the player must collect cucumbers randomly placed on the map. Some cucumbers only appear in certain locations, such as in the forest or near water.

### cucumber escape

The player must flee as long as possible from a virtual cucumber that appears on the map. Sometimes random items spawn that can help to briefly stop the cucumber.
